# American Express Default Prediction - Kaggle Competition 

This repository contains the three notebooks, which I used throughout the competition.

- feature_engineering.ipynb contains all steps performed for data preprocessing.

- train_xgb.ipynb contains an extensive grid search and permutation importance algorithm.

- valid_xgb.ipynb is used for predicting the models trained in train_xgb.ipynb.

Here is the [link][amex] to the competition.
